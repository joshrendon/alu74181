### 74181/74182 Carry Lookahead ALU — Restored Hades Java Simulator (2025 Edition)

Originally developed at the University of Hamburg for digital logic education (circa 2000–2006),
this interactive ALU simulator was rescued from the Internet Wayback Machine and made runnable on
modern Linux systems. It demonstrates the classic 4-bit 74181 ALU with a 74182 carry-lookahead
unit using the Hades logic simulator.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jrendon/alu74181.git
cd alu74181

Launch:
./alu74181
```

Optionally install Gnome Desktop Application link:
```bash
cp alu74181.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
```

# **Requirements**: OpenJDK 8 or Later (works best with AWT mode)
# Credits: TAMS Group, Universität Hamburg, for the original Hades simulator.
